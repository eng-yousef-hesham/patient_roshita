you go to the doctor page and you will see the doctor that you gave access to ( at max 6 ) you can remove this access and you can give access to another doctor<br>
when the patient wants to go to the doctor, he searches for the doctor who needs to visit and gives him access to see his medical history and write a prescription for once time<br>
