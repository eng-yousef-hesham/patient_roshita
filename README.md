<h1>patient roshita</h1>
<h2>introduction</h2>
this project will help both doctors and patients by helping doctors to know the medical history of patients and help patients to have digital prescriptions.
<h2>how to work</h2>
there are two ways:-

<h3>1 ) for patient</h3>
at first, the patient should have an account on our website <br>
then he can see who doctors he visited and the medicine that the doctor gave to you after your visit but <br>
the first time you will see that the prescription page is empty<br>
to add to this page you first should do that<br>
when the patient wants to go to the doctor, he searches for the doctor who needs to visit and gives him access to see his medical history and write a prescription for once time



<h3>2 ) for doctor</h3>
at first doctor should create an account and write his specialization now if any patient login he will see that there is a new doctor added to doctor page and he can give access to him.<br>
if the doctor opens a patient page he will be able to see the prescription that he wrote to  all patients who visited him and there is an area to allow the doctor to check if the new patient gave him access or not.<br>
if yes the doctor will be able to write a new prescription to this patient and can see his medical history.
